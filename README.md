# InceptionV3_DeepFakes_Model

The repository provides a sample implementation of deepfake detection via a InceptionV3 model. I strongly encourage you to use Google Colaboratory! Google Colaboratory is an online browser-based platform that allows us to train our models on Google Cloud virtual machines (yes with GPUs!) for free! 

It is worthy to note that this is only a base model and not the most efficient and practical model.
