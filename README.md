# InceptionV3_DeepFakes_Model

The repository contains a Jupyter notebook which provides a sample implementation of deepfake detection via a InceptionV3 model. I strongly encouraged you to use Google Colaboratory for the hackathon! Google Colaboratory is an online browser-based platform that allows us to train our models on Google Cloud virtual machines(yes with GPUs!) for free! Check out this Youtube video to get up to speed quickly with Google Colaboratory!
